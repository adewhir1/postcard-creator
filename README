-POSTCARD CREATOR-

This application takes image input from the user, modifies
the image, and sends it as an email to a specified recipient.

-GETTING STARTED-

As of 3/14/18, this application supports the latest versions of 
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Explorer. It has not been tested on
Opera.

You do not need to download any libraries or software to use
this application. You only need one of the browsers listed above.

You can try the app yourself at adewhir1.000webhostapp.com.

-FEATURES-

-Dynamic line wrapping if message is too long
-Resizes image to standard postcard size without distortion
-Supports image upload and webcam capture
-Sends email without relying on user's mail client
-Simple UI and step by step onscreen instructions

-KNOWN ISSUES-

-Drag and drop feature is still in development.
-Some email services (like gmail) cache image attachments. 
 Therefore, the first postcard the recipient gets will be accurate, 
 but gmail replaces subsequent postcards with the cached image.

-ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS-

-Lines 84 and 85 were copied from Stack Overflow.
